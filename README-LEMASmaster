LEMASmaster contains the package for overseeing all LEMAS devices and building the dmgenv.nist.gov website. Moderate familiarity with bash, Linux filesystems, and networking is required to make functional changes in the current version. LEMASmaster also contains the distribution package of LEMAS, LEMASdist, for LEMAS devices.

Before launching, an apache2 server is assumed to be set up and DNS redirected. /var/www/ should exist for dmgenv.nist.gov to populate, and given user permissions for rwx (chown -R $user /var/www/; chmod -R u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rx /var/www/). Paths need to be corrected too if not run from /home/braine/BraineCode/LEMASmaster. Hey, I'm not a developer, I do this mostly for fun.

To launch the monitoring system, cd to the directory containing EnvWebUpdate.sh and use:
sh EnvWebUpdate.sh

The script will run for all eternity collecting data from LEMAS devices listed in LabsMonitored.list. IP addresses need to be added and RSA keys built for any unfamiliar devices. In the current version, EnvWebUpdate.sh will need lines added to LabsMonitored.list to build the webpages and download data from unfamiliar devices.
